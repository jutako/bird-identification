# Bird Identification

A bird audio identification tool designed to analyze recordings and generate a list of bird species detected using an AI model. Built with TensorFlow and Python, it operates within a Docker environment. The project is a work in progress and currently in a very preliminary stage.

## Setup

- `git clone`
- `cd bird-identification`
- `mkdir input && mkdir output && mkdir models`
- Place models to the `app/models` folder: BirdNET and Muuttolintujen kev√§t
- `docker compose up --build; docker compose down;`
- Access the running docker container:
  - `docker exec -ti bird-identification bash`
  - `cd app`
  - Run the script, see below

## Usage

### Identifying species

This analyzes audio files and generates tabular text files containing the identifications, one file for each audio file.

- Place audio files to a subfolder of the `input` folder, for example `my_backyard_2025-01`. The script will search the audio files here in this order, and will load files from the first one that contains at least one of them:
  1) `./subfolder/data`
  2) `./subfolder/Data`
  3. `.subfolder`
- Place *metadata.yaml* file in the subfolder. The file should contain the following fields:
  - `lat`: Latitude in decimal degrees
  - `lon`: Longitude in decimal degrees
  - `day_of_year`: Day of the year, 1-365/6
- Run the script with `python main.py --dir <subfolder>`
- Optional parameters:
  - `--thr`: Detection threshold as a decimal number between 0<>1, default 0.5
  - `--noise`: Include noise in the output, default False
  - `--sdm`: Use species distribution model to adjust confidence values, default False
  - `--skip`: Skip audio files that already have a corresponding result file, default False

#### Note

- Expects that
    - Audio filenames are in format [part1].[extension]
    - Extension is wav, mp3 or flac
    - If data files have already been generated with another application (e.g. BirdNET), they are in the same directory as the audio files and in format [part1].[part2].results.csv
    - Data files have columns: Start (s), End (s), Scientific name, Common name, Confidence, [Optional columns]
- If classification stops with message "Killed", try restarting the Docker container. It's unclear what causes this issue.

### Generating validation report

This reads tabular files containing species identifications, and generates an HTML report with example audio files for validation, and statistics and charts of the species.

- First do species identification, see above
- Run the script with `python main_report.py --dir <subfolder>`
- Optional parameters:
  - `--thr`: Detection threshold as a decimal number between 0<>1, default 0.5
  - `--padding`: Padding in seconds for example audio files. Default 1.
  - `--examples`: Number of example audio files to pick for each species. Minimum 5, default 5.

## Todo

- Next:
  - Save model run metadata, include it into the report
  - How to handle multiple species being detected in the same time frame?
- Maybe later:
  - Include both sdm and non-sdm predictions in the output
  - Add taxon MX codes to the output
  - Check why comparison-audio files are sometimes split into 5, 6 or 7 segments
  - Spectrograms
  - Species commonness: how many % of observations from that area (+- 100 km) and time (+-10 days) are this species
  - Normalize x-axis for all temporal charts. Get first and last time from the original data when it's loaded?
  - Organizing the repos: continue with this repo, include baim features. Then rethink whether this tool and analysis (Bart) tool should be bundled together. And how to manage web interface vs. desktop app.
  - Error handling when functions return None
  - Prepare for missing audio files & missing data files
  - Running analysis should save settings to a metadata file. Report should show those settings.
  - Unit testing
  - Handle file paths in a more consistent ways (directory path, file name, datetime from filename)
  - Histograms are not made for species with only few detections. However, <img> tag is generated for these on the result service. Would be elegant not to have broken image links, though they are not visible for users.
